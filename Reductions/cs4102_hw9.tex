\begin{problem}Curbside Takeout \points{20}\end{problem}

    IKEA is growing in popularity across the US, however their stores are only found in a handful of larger metropolitan areas.  While their main product is furniture, they have become known for their signature meatballs.  To increase profits and make their delicious food more accessible, they have decided to open local take-out only IKEA Curbside restaurants in towns across the country.  Restaurant storefronts are expensive to rent and maintain, so they are happy with customers needing to drive at most to the next town over to get their IKEA meatball fix.  Specifically, their goal is that every town in America either has an IKEA Curbside, or its neighboring town has an IKEA Curbside.

Given a graph representing the towns and roads between them (representing the towns being neighbors), the \emph{Curbside} problem is to decide whether $k$ IKEA Curbside locations can be placed in order to ensure that each town or its neighbor has an IKEA Curbside location.  Show that \emph{Curbside Takeout} is NP-Complete.

Note: You are not being asked to explicitly solve the \emph{Curbside Takeout} problem; you are only required to show that it is NP-Complete.

\begin{problem} European Summer Vacation \points{20}\end{problem}

You and a friend are heading to Europe for the summer (hopefully!).  You have completed your packing list, and combined, you need to bring $n$ items in total, with the weights of the items given by $W = (w_1, \ldots, w_n)$.  Your goal is to divide the items between your suitcases such that the difference in weight between them is at most $t$. We formally define the problem below: 

\begin{framed}
  \noindent
  \textsc{Suitcase}: Given a sequence of non-negative weights $W = (w_1, \ldots, w_n)$ and a target weight difference
  $t$, can you divide the items among you and your friend such that the weight difference between suitcases is at most $t$?
\end{framed}
  
  Show that the \textsc{Suitcase} problem defined above is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete (namely, you should
  show that $\textsc{Suitcase} \in \mathsf{NP}$ and that \textsc{Suitcase} is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard). For this
  problem, you may use the fact that the \textsc{SubsetSum} problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete:

  \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}
  \begin{framed}
    \textsc{SubsetSum}: Given a sequence of non-negative integers $a_1, \ldots, a_n$
    and a target value $t$, does there exist
    a subset $S \subseteq \{ 1, \ldots, n \}$ such that $\sum_{i \in S} a_i = t$?
  \end{framed}
  \end{minipage}

    {\footnotesize \textbf{Extra Credit Instructions:} For each of the next three written homeworks (HW6, HW7, HW9), you will be given an extra credit problem, with the opportunity to replace one homework at the end of the course.  Combined, the extra credit portions are worth $60$ points---the same as one normal homework assignment.  Each Extra Credit portion (EC1, EC2, EC3) will be combined into one \emph{optional} replacement homework, meaning that the total scored out of all $60$ extra credit points will replace your lowest homework grade for the semester.  Note: this extra credit will \textbf{not} be applied to this homework (HW\hnumber).  To make the most of this opportunity, you should commit to solving \textbf{all} extra credit portions for the next three homework assignments.}

\begin{extra} Insert/Delete/Min Data Structure \end{extra}

Prove whether there exists a data structure where the operations $\mathtt{INSERT}$ (which inserts a given element into the data structure), $\mathtt{DELETE}$ (which removes a given element from the data structure, should it be present), and $\mathtt{MIN}$ (which returns the minimum element from the data structure) require $O(1)$ worst-case time each.
